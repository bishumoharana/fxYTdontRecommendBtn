# YouTube Don't Recommend Channel Button Extension

A Firefox extension that adds a custom "Don't Recommend Channel" button to YouTube video cards, making it easier to block unwanted channels from your recommendations.

---

## Features

- Adds a ðŸš« button to every YouTube video card (homepage, search results, recommendations).
- Clicking the button mimics the "Don't Recommend Channel" action from YouTubeâ€™s three-dot menu.
- Works seamlessly with YouTubeâ€™s dynamic content loading (infinite scroll).

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Firefox browser.

### Steps
1. **Download the Extension**:
   - Clone this repository or download the ZIP file.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/youtube-dont-recommend-button.git
   ```

2. **Load the Extension in Firefox**:
   - Open Firefox and go to `about:debugging`.
   - Click **"This Firefox"** in the sidebar.
   - Click **"Load Temporary Add-on"**.
   - Select the `manifest.json` file from the downloaded repository.

3. **Use the Extension**:
   - Go to YouTube and browse videos.
   - Youâ€™ll see a ðŸš« button next to the three-dot menu (`â‹®`) on each video card.
   - Click the button to block the channel from your recommendations.

## How It Works

The extension injects a custom button into YouTubeâ€™s video cards using a **content script**. When clicked, it:
1. Opens the three-dot menu (`â‹®`) programmatically.
2. Clicks the "Don't Recommend Channel" option in the menu.

The extension uses a **MutationObserver** to handle YouTubeâ€™s dynamic content loading (e.g., infinite scroll).
